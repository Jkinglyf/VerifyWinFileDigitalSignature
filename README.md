# VerifyWinFileDigitalSignature

A library to verify the digital signature of a windows exe ( 32 bit and 64 bit ).

A while back, I had to work on project where I had to verify the digital signature 
of a windows exe. Windows has a lot of APIs to do this kind of stuff but you can only 
use them on a windows based OS.

Therefore, I had to write this code to check the digital signature of a windows exe using java.
